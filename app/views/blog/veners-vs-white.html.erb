    <h4>tudies have confirmed that a white and evenly spaced set of teeth makes people seem more attractive, Because teeth are the human equivalent of a peacock’s tail - a sign of health and genetic quality designed to help choose a mate.
    And Let's face it ,everyone wants to have flawless white teeth with an impeccable smile and which better way to do so other than Veneers or white bleaching ; they are the most common , easy and accurate ways to whiten your teeth. Which lands a big question mark in the minds of our users “which one is better”? Bleaching takes very little time (55-65 minutes a session but is a little bit irritating to sensitive teeth , on the other hand veneers are more durable and are carefully customized to match each individuals needs. Now let's put an end to this ongoing debate and decide which is better for you. </h4><br>

    <h4>Here are the important factors to consider while choosing your own method</h4><br>

    <h4>First off, white bleaching has the speed factor while taking about an hour only to complete, and can be tailored on the shade , degree or whitening you want to achieve. In some cases a one single treatment may be all that it takes to get the result you want.The downside of bleaching is that there are various limitations as Tooth whitening tends to be effective for people who have yellow shaded teeth, but less effective for people with brown or gray shades. Also, the treatment only works on natural teeth, but will not work on crowns, fillings, or bonding materials.</h4><br>

    <h4>As we mentioned earlier Veneers can be fully customized to match each individuals teeth meaning that you can actually choose the shade and tone you want your teeth to eventually have. Tooth whitening using bleach does not give you this kind of flexibility also Dental veneers are very stain resistant, meaning that the foods and drinks that will cause your tooth whitening treatment to fade will not affect your dental veneers.
    As popular and widely spread veneers are , they do have a significant downside , which is the cost of dental veneers is relatively high ,and in the rare event ,where the veneers are damaged, repairing the damage<br>can further add to the cost.</h4><br>
