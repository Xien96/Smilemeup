    desc5: 'The possible risks associated with the use of sprockets are not different from those of other cosmetic periodontal products. The use of Smile Me Up products is recommended only for periodontally and dental stable customers. The use of this products can have some of the risks listed below. However, many of the aforementioned risks also exist without any use of the toothed rails. Therefore, Smile Me Up would like to clarify the following risks, as far as this is necessary in individual cases:

            A certain sensitivity of the teeth is to be expected after the insertion of the cosmetic dental product. A slight pressure sensation can result. In addition, irritation can occur on the gums, cheeks and lips.
            • Caries, periodontal diseases or gum infections on the teeth can occur when the customer takes sugary foods and does not thoroughly clean the teeth or lacks adequate oral hygiene.
            • The toothed rails can temporarily affect the speaking ability.
            • The use of the equipment may temporarily result in increased salivary flow or mouth dryness. Certain medications can enhance this effect.
            • The health of bones and gums that support the teeth can be compromised.
            • The product can break by improper pressure or bite.
            • The product or their parts can be inadvertently swallowed or inhaled. This risk is increased if the toothed rails are shortened or modified by the customer.
            • In rare cases, problems with the temporomandibular joint can also occur which can cause joint pain, headache or ear problems.
            • Allergic reactions may occur.'

    desc8: 'As a consumer within the meaning of § 13 BGB (German Civil Code), you are entitled to a right of withdrawal in the event of a conclusion of the contract with the exclusive use of telecommunication means (distance agreement) in accordance with §§ 355, 356 BGB.
            You may revoke a contract in accordance with the following provisions:

            Cancellation

            You have the right to revoke the contract within fourteen days without giving reasons.
            The revocation period is 30 days. However, if you have already used the impression kit, this service is not returnable. In case you have ordered a Clear Up, the service costs 150€, for Snap Up 50€.
            To exercise your right of revocation, you must inform us,

            Smile Me Up GmbH
            Arnheimerstr. 23
            40489 Dusseldorf, Germany
            Email: info@smilemeuponline.com

            by means of a clear statement (eg a letter or e-mail sent by mail) about your decision to revoke this contract. You can use the enclosed sample revocation form, but this is not required.
            In order to keep the revocation period, it is sufficient that you send the notification of the exercise of the right of revocation before the end of the revocation period.

            Consequences of revocation

            If you revoke the contract, we will pay you all the payments we have received from you, including the delivery costs (except for the additional costs resulting from the fact that you have chosen a different type of delivery than the most favorable standard delivery offered by us ) within a period of fourteen days from the date on which the notice of revocation of the contract has been received by us.

            For the repayment, we use the same payment you used in the original transaction, unless you explicitly agreed with another type of repayment; in no case will you be charged for these repayment fees.
            We may refuse the repayment until we have returned the impression set or until you have demonstrated that you have sent the impression set back unsealed, whichever is earlier. You have to return the impression set to us immediately or in any case at the latest within 14 days from the date on which you inform us of the cancellation of the contract. The deadline is respected when you send the goods before the deadline of 14 days.
            They bear the direct costs (if no use of the returned return certificate is made) of the return of the goods.
            They must pay for a possible loss of value of the impression set if this loss of value is attributable to a handling which is not necessary for checking the quality, characteristics and functioning of the goods, eg use of the impression material and impression trays. The costs are € 50 (Snap Up)/150€ (Clear Up).

            Exclusion or expiry of the right of revocation

            According to Article 312g (2) of the German Civil Code (BGB), a right of revocation does not apply to contracts for the delivery of goods which are not prefabricated and whose manufacture is subject to an individual selection or provision by the consumer or which are clearly tailored to the personal needs of the consumer. Therefore, a revocation is only valid for the unused impression set but not for the individually manufactured toothed rails.
            In addition, there is no right of revocation or extinguishes prematurely, in the case of contracts for the delivery of sealed goods which are not suitable for return for reasons of health or hygiene if their seal has been removed after delivery.
            Model withdrawal form
            If you want to cancel the contract, please complete this form and send it to:

    desc9: 'According to experience, a correction or adaptation need may occur in special products (custom-made toothed rails). Thus, it is conceivable that the toothed rails do not fit immediately in some places, but appear too large or too small, too narrow or too wide. Such phenomena are not always completely excluded in the case of individual custom-made products. A certain adaptation and post-processing requirement is normal and does not represent a deficiency of the toothed rails.
            We therefore offer you the opportunity to try out each individually designed toothed rack first and to carry out a maximum of two subsequent improvements within the first three months as far as necessary, and to return them to us, indicating your change requests. To do this, please use the download form on our onlineshop.
            The customer bears the shipping costs incurred. We would like to point out that you always ship the goods in an air-cushioned envelope or package. This is also assured by a transport insurance company at the supplier who will instruct you. We will coordinate the concrete correction requirements in a personal consultation and make the desired adjustments to your tooth guides.
            We carry out two adaptations, which are commissioned within three months after receipt of the toothed racks, free of charge for you. In this case, you only pay the costs of sending the toothed racks to us.
            Decisive for the timely commissioning is the access of your change requests in addition to the affected toothed rack in our home.'

             a. The limitation period does not apply in the case of intent or in the case of malicious concealment of a defect or to the extent that Smile Me Up
             has assumed a guarantee for the quality of the delivery item .

             Furthermore, the limitation period does not apply
             in case of injury to life, body or health;
             • in case of intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty;

             • as long as the scope of the Product Liability Act is in force.
             The one-year limitation period also applies to the reimbursement of futile expenses.
             The statute of limitations begins with all claims for damages with the delivery.

             Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the statutory provisions on the commencement of the statute of limitations, the expiry of the term, the suspension and the new beginning of time limits shall remain unaffected.
             The foregoing provisions of this clause shall apply mutatis mutandis to claims for damages which are not related to a defect, insofar as they apply to compensation claims.
             A change of the burden of proof to your disadvantage is not connected with the above regulations.

             Two improvements
             If, in the event of a defect, you claim damages instead of the performance and the toothed rails have to be repaired, a defect of the repair shall be assumed at the earliest after the unsuccessful second attempt. The legal cases of the dispensability of the deadline remain unaffected.

        sentence1: "tudies have confirmed that a white and evenly spaced set of teeth makes people seem more attractive, Because teeth are the human equivalent of a peacock’s tail - a sign of health and genetic quality designed to help choose a mate.
                        And Let's face it ,everyone wants to have flawless white teeth with an impeccable smile and which better way to do so other than Veneers or white bleaching ; they are the most common , easy and accurate ways to whiten your teeth. Which lands a big question mark in the minds of our users “which one is better”? Bleaching takes very little time (55-65 minutes a session but is a little bit irritating to sensitive teeth , on the other hand veneers are more durable and are carefully customized to match each individuals needs. Now let's put an end to this ongoing debate and decide which is better for you."
        sentence2: 'Here are the important factors to consider while choosing your own method'
        sentence3: 'First off, white bleaching has the speed factor while taking about an hour only to complete, and can be tailored on the shade , degree or whitening you want to achieve. In some cases a one single treatment may be all that it takes to get the result you want.The downside of bleaching is that there are various limitations as Tooth whitening tends to be effective for people who have yellow shaded teeth, but less effective for people with brown or gray shades. Also, the treatment only works on natural teeth, but will not work on crowns, fillings, or bonding materials.'
        sentence4: 'As we mentioned earlier Veneers can be fully customized to match each individuals teeth meaning that you can actually choose the shade and tone you want your teeth to eventually have. Tooth whitening using bleach does not give you this kind of flexibility also Dental veneers are very stain resistant, meaning that the foods and drinks that will cause your tooth whitening treatment to fade will not affect your dental veneers.
                        As popular and widely spread veneers are , they do have a significant downside , which is the cost of dental veneers is relatively high ,and in the rare event ,where the veneers are damaged, repairing the damage<br>can further add to the cost.'

One of the biggest advantages of getting metal braces is their cost compared to other common straightening treatments is relatively low. This makes them a popular alternative for those who are on a tight budget. It is also possible to start your orthodontics treatment using metal braces first to perform the complex tooth alignment and then switch to clear , white braces to bring the teeth into their final stage.'
